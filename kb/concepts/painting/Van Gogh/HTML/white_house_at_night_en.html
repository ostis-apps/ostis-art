<h1>White House at Night</h1>
According to the Hermitage Museum, the painting "expresses the great psychological tension under which Van Gogh found himself"; two of the windows, considered the "eyes" of a home, are rendered with "alarming" red splashes, while the star, a sign of fate, is seen as symbolic of van Gogh's anguish. It is thought that van Gogh painted White House at Night around 8:00 PM due to the position of the "star" in the painting.
