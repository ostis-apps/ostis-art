<h1>Les Alyscamps</h1>
This autumn landscape was created by Van Gogh in the French city of Arles during the two-month period of work with Paul Gauguin. Purple poplar trunks cut by frame exactly where the foliage begins. These trees, as columns, bordered by an alley, on both sides lined up a purple-blue Roman tombs. Earth is already littered with dense carpet of orange and yellow fallen leaves, and the new all fall down like snow flakes. The alley black figurines of lovers.
