<h1>The Seine Bridge at Asnieres</h1>
Bridges across the Seine at Asnieres was painted in open air and bright sunlight. The scene depicts railway bridges over the river. Van Gogh uses light and reflection effectively in this painting. The stone piers of the bridge are reflected in the water and white paint is used for highlights.
