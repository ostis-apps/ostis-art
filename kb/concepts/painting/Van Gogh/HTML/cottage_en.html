<h1>The Cottage</h1>
The old cottage beneath the red evening sky presents an idyllic picture of rural life. Van Gogh called these humble farmhouses 'people's nests'. He felt they had a sheltering quality. This cottage contains two houses with two front doors and a shared chimney. That type of dwelling was then on the brink of disappearing. 'The thing struck me greatly; those two cottages, half decayed under one and the same thatched roof, reminded me of a couple of worn-out old folk who make up just one single being and whom one sees supporting each other,' he wrote.
