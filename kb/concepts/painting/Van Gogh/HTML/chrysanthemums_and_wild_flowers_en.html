<h1>Chrysanthemums and Wild Flowers in a Vase</h1>
This still life is not mentioned in Van Gogh’s letters and has puzzled scholars as to its place in his artistic production. The subject enjoys a certain rapport with the mixed bouquets of summer flowers he made in Paris; the quasi-abstract floral wallpaper design in the Berceuse of Arles , and the white porcelain vase in the Irises of Saint-Rémy .
