<h1>Cafe Table with Absinthe</h1>
Van Gogh painted this caf√© table with a view in highly thinned oil paint with thin brushes. The result looks something like a watercolour. The glass holds absinthe, a popular aperitif. Its alcohol content was 60 to 70%, and it was often mixed with water. Van Gogh drank it frequently. Absinthe was very bad for one's health.
