<h1>Self-Portrait</h1>
This early example of  self-portrait is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist’s board rather than canvas. The surface of the painting dances with particles of color—intense greens, blues, reds, and oranges. Dominating this dazzling array of staccato dots and dashes are the artist’s deep green eyes and the intensity of their gaze.
