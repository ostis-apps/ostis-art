<h1>View of a Butcher's Shop</h1>
This is the first painting made by Van Gogh after his arrival in Arles. He painted it in the Carrel hotel and restaurant. For the first few months of his time in Arles, he rented a room there. We look outside through the door. There is snow on the street. The sun is shining, making the scene sparkle. Across the street is the butcher shop. On the shop front, the name 'Reboul Charcutier' is visible. On the right of the shop window, sausages have been hung to dry.
