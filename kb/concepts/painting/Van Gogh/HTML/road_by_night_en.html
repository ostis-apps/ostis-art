<h1>Country road in Provence by night</h1>
Van Gogh paints Country road in Provence by night shortly before leaving the asylum at Saint-Rémy. This is not an existing landscape, but instead composed at his own discretion, presumably as a final reminder of Saint-Rémy and as a summary of the many impressions he acquired during his stay in Provence. Van Gogh experiments with his use of colour and brushwork in Saint-Rémy. Many works are composed of graceful forms and swirling lines. The short, rhythmic wavy brushstrokes placed side by side give the painting great dynamism.
