<h1>Gauguin's Chair</h1>
This painting of Paul Gauguin's chair is a 'portrait' of Van Gogh's friend and fellow artist. The modern novels and burning candle on the green seat cushion symbolize the character of the absent painter. Using mainly red and green hues, Van Gogh tried to suggest the mood of night.
