<h1>Sorrowing Old Man</h1>
The best glimpse into Vincent’s state of mind is through his own words, in the hundreds of letters he wrote to his brother, Theo. Vincent painted Sorrowing Old Man in 1890, while he was a patient at the Monastery Saint-Paul de Mausole mental hospital in Saint-Rémy. The hospital seemed to help Vincent maintain a calm demeanor. It’s doubtful that Vincent ever saw himself as the sad old man of his future, but unfortunately, it seems he saw himself this way as a young man at various times in his life.
