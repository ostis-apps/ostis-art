<h1>Vase with Cornflowers and Poppies</h1>
Among the flower still-lifes the present canvas is perhaps the most brilliant and exuberant of its kind. It is characterized by luxurious colour and spontaneous but sure brushwork. Against a loosely painted blue background the artist placed a bouquet of bright red poppies, intensely blue cornflowers, and creamy white marguerites. The narrow vase is placed on a shimmering, but loosely defined surface. The composition vibrates with colour and capture the moment of summer at which these flowers would have been in bloom.
