<h1>Head of a Skeleton with a Burning Cigarette</h1>
This skeleton with a lit cigarette in its mouth is a juvenile joke. Van Gogh painted it in early 1886, while studying at the art academy in Antwerp. The painting shows that he had a good command of anatomy.Drawing skeletons was a standard exercise at the academy, but painting them was not part of the curriculum.
