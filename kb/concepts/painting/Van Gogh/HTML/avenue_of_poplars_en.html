<h1>Avenue of Poplars in Autumn</h1>
This painting portrays a road, centered on the canvas, and a house in the far background. Van Gogh positioned a single character on the forefront wearing all black and walking across a small cross bridge. The road was painted with shades of brown, red and orange. The tall tree trunks take up almost all of the long, vertical canvas — highlighting the path even more — and have red, orange and green leaves on top that contrast with the blue sky. In this painting, the effect of light and shadow is not entirely realistic: the shadows cast by the trees do not fall in the same direction as those bast by the rails.
