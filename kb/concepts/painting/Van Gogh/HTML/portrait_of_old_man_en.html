<h1>Portrait of an Old Man</h1>
Van Gogh painted this man in Antwerp, where he lived from late November 1885 to late February 1886. He has impressive features, as Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo. Van Gogh thought that the man's full beard made him look like the author Victor Hugo. Using rough but well-placed brushstrokes, he made a compelling portrait.
