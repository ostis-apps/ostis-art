<h1>Almond Blossom</h1>
Large blossom branches like this against a blue sky were one of Van Goghâ€™s favourite subjects. Almond trees flower early in the spring making them a symbol of new life. Van Gogh borrowed the subject, the bold outlines and the positioning of the tree in the picture plane from Japanese printmaking.
