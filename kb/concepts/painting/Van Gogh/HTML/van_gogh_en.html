<h1>Vincent Willem van Gogh </h1>
Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist 
painter who is among the most famous and influential 
figures in the history of Western art. In just over 
a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including 
around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the 
last two years of his life. They include landscapes, 
still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are 
characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive 
and expressive brushwork that contributed to the 
foundations of modern art. He was not commercially 
successful, and his suicide at 37 came after years of 
mental illness, depression and poverty.
